> **D**ata-structure **I**nterface **Y**ourself using **Py**thon 3.

This is a C extension module for Python 3 which provides homemade and
basic data types for your Python 3 interpreter. In the module there
are Python 3 functions for formatting input data, transfering to C
program and visualizing output data, and C functions for creating data
types, traversal and manipulating exceptions, etc.

Attention, this project is experimental and inspired by my current
professional course **Data Structure**. Just like my learning notes.

Requirements
------------

- `Python 3.4.x` or higher versions
- `Graphviz (DOT)` for visualizing *graphs*
